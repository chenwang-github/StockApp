# ForgetCurve Project Instructions

## Initial Project Analysis
1. **First Conversation Protocol**: On the first conversation, read the entire project structure in explorer to understand the codebase layout and architecture.

2. **README Documentation**: 
   - Read the README file thoroughly
   - Update project structure documentation if needed
   - Add one-line comments describing the purpose of each file/folder
   - Check if existing README coverage needs updates

## Response Guidelines
3. **Question Answering**:
   - Provide brief, concise answers
   - Include possible solutions when relevant
   - When designing and recommending solutions, always consider the current project design and architecture
   - Only provide detailed explanations when explicitly asked

## Code Implementation Policy
4. **Code Changes**: 
   - **DO NOT** make any code changes unless explicitly told "start implement"
   - Only discuss solutions and provide guidance until implementation is requested
